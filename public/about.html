<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michael Chavez. I grew up in a small beach town in south Texas called Rockport.Throughout my life I always
  found myself interested in building and creating things as well as just understadning how things worked. Many times
  I would take things apart and put them back together just so I could understand how it worked and why it was built
  that way. I could spend hours doing this and it would seem like hardly any time had passed. After realizing how
  interested I was in these types of activities it was easy for me to realize I wanted to go to college for some type of 
  engineering. I ended up decding to pursue an undergraduate degree in Mechanical-Nuclear Engineering.

  After graduating and working for several years as an engineer, I discovered I also had deep passion for computers and software
  that I did not realize I had before. While working as an engineer I saw how software is used in everything I did as an engineer
  and I began to realize how many obstacles I was encountering in which software could provide a solution. This is when I began
  to really see how beneficial and valueable software was and understand all the applications it could be used for. I then
  decided to enroll in a Software Engineering Masters program as well as take Udemy courses so that I can become a Software Engineer
  and begin creating really cool and useful software for myself and the world.

<p>A few other things about me are my hobies. Growing up on the beach I always loved being out on the water and still do so anything
  outdoors or around or in the water I love to do. Some of these things include: fishing, swimming, snorkling, scuba diving, 
  underwater metal detecting, water sports, boating, kayaking, and even just relaxing out by the water is very enjoyable to me. I also 
  really enjoy any other types of sports and outdoor activites like camping, hiking, biking, etc. Count me in on any indoor games and
  sports as well. I love staying healthy, eating good food, and going to the gym as well so if anyone is looking for someone to join 
  along on any of these types of activites then I am always game.
