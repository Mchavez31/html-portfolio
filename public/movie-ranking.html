<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite space and exploration movie. 
I like the interesting images, creative planet environments, and the complex science related concepts.

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite scifi movie. 
I like all the creativity used in depicting a new world with unkown 
living beings and animals as well as the idea of humans being able to transfer their consciousness into an avatar.

<h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite action/superhero movie. 
I love all the teamwork between the superheros and all the creative fighting scenes in the movie. 
It also has funny scenes and a very good storyline. 
Some of the story is so good that it can get emotional at times.
